      <li>Wednesday: Martial Arts at Victory Martial Arts (Ruskin)</li>

    <p class="lg:text-3xl text-xl mb-8">
      Our days begin with daily devotions, scripture, and prayer, grounding
      students in Biblical truth. Families are partners in this journeyâ€”we walk
      alongside you as your child grows academically, spiritually, and socially.
